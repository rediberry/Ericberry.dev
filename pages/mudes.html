      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>The MUDES project was a freelance proposal obtained as a reward  for completing the Coderhouse JavaScript course within the Top 10 ranking.The team consisted of two developers, two UX/UI designers and a community manager.<br>
        MUDES (Mujeres Unidas para el Desarrollo Social) is an independent non-profit organization that seeks to promote the integral autonomy of women in vulnerable contexts. They act in vulnerable communities, guiding future women leaders to become the protagonists of their own change through comprehensive assistance in the areas of education, work, mental and physical health.
        They looked to evolve by offering the community the chance to be part of this movement by supporting their work in 3 different ways, donations, sponsorship or volunteers.<br><br>
        This case study details the process undertaken to design and deliver a responsive website for MUDES.</p>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>I participated in the creation of a custom website and managed the project from inception to completion. I was involved in stakeholder interviews, functionality development, website development and testing.
          I collaborated with another developer for the build. </p>

      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <h3>Stakeholder Interview</h3>
      <p>The project kicked off with an in-depth interview with MUDES Co-founder Fiorella Trujillo and Sustainability officer Anghella Román. Through this session I gained valuable information about the organization, their motivation for the project as well as the hard work they have been doing in general.<br><br>
        Some of the key takeaways from the interview included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Information:</strong> The website must clearly show the KPIs improved by the initiatives performed.</p> 
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Target audience:</strong> The page should be targeted to investors, partners, supporters of the cause. People interested in contributing their time or financial support.</p> 
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Functionality and design:</strong> The website should offer the possibility of integrating contact forms, offer information for donations and have an attractive design that represents the core values of MUDES.</p> 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="banner2"></div>
      <h3>Researching the Domain</h3>
      <p>My next step was to better understand the nonprofit landscape and familiarize myself with how similar organizations in the region had approached their websites in terms of design, features and content. I examined a number of alternatives to determine what they were doing well and what could be improved.</p>
      <h3>Understanding the Users</h3>
      <p>At this point, the research team conducted a survey and determined that the main users of the site were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Donors:</strong> A person interested in giving funds or other material goods.</p> 
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Sponsors:</strong> It is an organization that is linked to the project through economic resources (monetary or not). They are responsible for the success of a project and provide the necessary guidance and resources to the team and manager working on the project.</p> 
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Volunteers:</strong> Person interested in contributing their time to the project through involvement in different support activities.</p> 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Revised Sitemap and wireframe</h3>
      <p>With everything in mind, the next step for the design team was to develop a <strong><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/vOKK3E9zYBXTvAOEqkNR1V/Wireframes-en-baja?node-id=0%3A1&t=BcapzjfY0iIKM3Pl-0" target="_blank">low-fidelity wireframe</a></strong> for the new website. This was an iterative process based on feedback, with the goal of structuring content into more logical areas and reducing the number of steps required for common tasks.</p>
      <div class="banner3"></div>
      <h3>Translating the sketches into digital form</h3>
      <p>In the next step, the design team experimented with different colour schemes, typography, UI elements and images; circling back to the client for feedback and undertaking a number of iterations before arriving at <strong><a href="https://www.figma.com/file/68CSwugRXX1k5LedjZBR0i/Prototipo-1.0-MUDES?node-id=0%3A1&t=tCaufzb8EUNrSlcD-0" target="_blank">the final design solution.</a></strong></p>
      <div class="banner4"></div>
      <h3>Building the solution</h3>
      <p>In the final step, I collaborated with another developer to translate the final digital design into a website. We built the site using a branching strategy known as "GitFlow" and also managed the project in an agile way incorporating Kanban methodology.
      Finally when the site was ready, it was deployed on the domain purchased by MUDES.

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <P>The MUDES website design project was exciting, challenging and rewarding. The opportunity to be part of a multidisciplinary team and to be involved in the project from inception to completion provided me with invaluable experience and many lessons learned.</P>
